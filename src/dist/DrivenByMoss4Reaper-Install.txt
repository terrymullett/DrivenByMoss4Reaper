1) Unzip the downloaded file "DrivenByMoss4Reaper-X.XX.zip" to your harddisc 
   and make sure you keep the folder structure of the files intact.

2) Install the Reaper SWS extension: http://www.sws-extension.org/

3) Install Java

   Get it from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
   You can either use the latest version 8 or 10 (Choose "JDK" to download).
   After you have installed the JDK you need to configure the environment variable
   JAVA_HOME:

    a) Windows 10
       Set JAVA_HOME to the installed Java Runtime, e.g. 
       C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_181 on my system.
       If you have no idea how to do that, search the web for "setting environment 
       variable Window 10".

    b) Mac OS X
       The installation adds the Java application automatically to the environment. 
       Therefore, no further configuration was necessary. Was? Yes, with OS X 10.13
       the environment variables are hidden from applications. Oh, how I love OS X.
       Now, we have to jump through some hoops:
        - Open the Applications folder
        - Right click on the Reaper folder and select to open the package
        - In the opened Reaper folder you should see a file called "Info.plist"
        - Open it in a text editor.
        - Locate the position which looks like this (close to the end of the file):
            ...
            </array>
            <key>CFBundleExecutable</key>
            ...
          Between those lines you can insert the environment variable, like this:
            ...
            </array>
            <key>LSEnvironment</key>
              <dict>
                <key>JAVA_HOME</key>
                <string>/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-10.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home</string>
              </dict>
            <key>CFBundleExecutable</key>
            ...
          Adjust the version number to your installation.
       NOTE: If you update Reaper this file will be overwritten! You have to 
       configure it again.
    
    c) Linux
       On Linux you have several options to configure environment variables. 
       If you are a Linux user you should know how to do that :-) If you have no
       idea simply search the web for "configure environment variable Ubuntu".

3) Install the DrivenByMoss libraries in the Reaper UserPlugins folder.
   Copy everything from the "lib" folder which you extracted above (the 
   3 library files reaper_drivenbymoss and the drivenbymoss-libs folder
   with all its contents).
   You find the UserPlugins folder at the following locations (it should already 
   contain the SWS library from Step 2):

   a) Windows 10
          C:\Users\<YOUR_USER_NAME>\AppData\Roaming\REAPER\UserPlugins
      Note that the AppData folder is hidden, you need to make it visible
      by enabling "Show hidden files" in the View tab of explorer.

   b) Mac OS X
          ~/Library/Application Support/REAPER/UserPlugins
      These folders are hidden as well. Press cmd+shift+. in the finder
      to make them visible.

   c) Linux (Ubuntu)
      Look up the location at which you have installed Reaper. 
      Install the *.so file into ~/.config/REAPER/UserPlugins or in the case of a 
      portable install into REAPER/UserPlugins.

4) Configuration
   a) Start Reaper
   b) Open the Preferences (Ctrl+P)
   c) Scroll down and select "Control/OSC/web"
   d) Click on "Add"
   e) In the "Control surface mode" select "DrivenByMoss4Reaper" (if it is not 
      there, you put the reaper_drivenbymoss library file into a wrong location).
   f) The configuration displays the JAVA_HOME path for information and contains
      a button to open the DrivenByMoss user interface. You can keep this user 
      interface open if you want and only close the Reaper dialogs.
      Use the Add button in the window to add the device(s) you want to use.
      Select a device and click the configure button to change its settings.
      Your setup will automatically be loaded if you run Reaper and shutdown when 
      you close Reaper.
