1) Unzip the downloaded file "DrivenByMoss4Reaper-X.XX.zip" to your harddisc (choose any 
   folder you like but make sure you have write access to it or otherwise 
   the configuration files of the application cannot be stored).

2) Configure Reaper communication
    a) Install the Reaper SWS extension: http://www.sws-extension.org/
    b) Start Reaper and open the Action list (Actions -> Show action list...)
    c) In the right lower corner you see "ReaScript:"; click the "Load..." button next to it.
    d) Locate the file "DrivenByMoss-Main.eel" in the folder called "EEL", which is part of
       the DrivenByMoss download, select it and click on "Open".
    e) In the list a new entry "Script: DrivenByMoss-Main.eel" appeared (if you do not see it 
       type "script" in the filter slot on the top of the dialog). Right click
       on the entry. From the appearing menu select "Copy selected action command ID".
    f) Close the action dialog.
    g) Open the menu: Extensions -> Startup actions -> Set global startup action
       Note: The extensions menu is only present if you successfully installed SWS in step a)
    h) Paste the command ID from step e), e.g. Right-Click on the field and select paste.
    i) Confirm the dialog and close Reaper. The script for the extended communication will now
      be automatically started every time you start Reaper.

4) Install the DrivenByMoss4Reaper application
    This application communicates with Reaper via an UDP port (default 1200) and the Reascript
    running in Reaper on one side and with the Controllers via MIDI and/or USB on the other.

    If supported by the Java/OS platform the application is run as a tray icon.
    Closing the app minimizes it to the tray. Double click the tray icon to show it again.
    Click on the tray icon (Right click on Windows) to show the context menu with the options to
    show the application or to exit it. If Auto-run is enabled, the app is automatically
    minimized on startup.

    a) The application is written in Java to run on Windows and Mac. 
       Therefore, make sure you have the latest Java Runtime installed (at 
       least 1.8.0_171). OpenJDK will not work since it does not include JavaFX 
       at the moment! Get it from: 
       http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html 
       (see below for which file to choose)
       
    b) Installation on Windows
       For the Java installation choose the file jdk-8u171-windows-x64.exe (or newer). There
       is a batch file "DrivenByMoss4Reaper.bat" provided to start the application. Make sure 
       you have the environment variable JAVA_HOME set to the installed Java Runtime, e.g. 
       C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_171 on my system. Alternatively, you can 
       also replace the path directly in the batch file.

    c) Optional: Add DrivenByMoss4Reaper.bat to the start menu of Windows 10 with the Reaper 
       icon:
       - Open the following folder in the Explorer (insert your user name): 
            C:\Users**\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs
       - Drag and drop "DrivenByMoss4Reaper.bat" to that folder while holding down the Alt-key 
         to create a link.
       - Select the link and press F2 to rename it.
       - Name it something like "Reaper with DrivenByMoss"
       - Right click on "DrivenByMoss4Reaper.bat" and open the properties dialog
       - Press the button which allows to select a different icon
       - In the upcoming dialog click on the file select button
       - Navigate to the Reaper installation folder (C:\Program Files\REAPER (x64)) 
         and select the "reaper.exe" file.
       - Select the Reaper icon and confirm all dialogs.
       - Open up the start menu by pressing the Windows key
       - Type Reaper. "Reaper with DrivenByMoss" should appear now in the search results.
       - Right click on "Reaper with DrivenByMoss4Reaper" and choose to add it to the start menu

    d) Installation on Mac OS X
       For the Java installation choose the file jdk-8u171-macosx-x64.dmg (or newer). The installation 
       adds the Java application automatically to the environment. Therefore, no further 
       configuration is necessary. 
       You can start the application with "DrivenByMoss" which is included in the folder (see the 
       Mac OS X issues below!).

       To automatically close the Terminal window, in Terminal app open
          Preferences > Profiles > (Select a Profile) > Shell
          and for 'When the shell exits' chosen 'Close the window' or 'Only when error'.

       Issues on Mac OS X:
       
       - If you get an error that you do not have access. Open a console and enter
         the directory which contains the "DrivenByMoss" command. Then execute the command
         "chmod a+x DrivenByMoss".

       - If you run Reaper without the Java app running it might crash. In that case you could remove
         the EEL script from autostart and run it manually (assign a keyboard shortcut) when you want 
         to use DrivenByMoss.
